            <section class="left">
                <p>As part of our ideation process, we utilised Padlet to brainstorm a series of different health issues.
                    <br><br>though we had a few ideas we knew we wanted to explore further, brainstorming as many issues that we could think of would keep our horizons open.
                    <br><br>After we established common issues, we then expanded on each issue with a few different methods for how one might track said issue.
                    <br><br>For example, if one were to choose Diet as the main issue to bring forward and develop, one may wish to track fluid intake, calories consumed, blood pressure and so forth.

                <h3>Pitch One - Sleep</h3>
                <p>For students with sleeping troubles who would like to regain control of their health via better sleep.
                    <br><br>Simply Sleep is a mobile app that provides tools for tracking the amount one sleeps, what times they sleep and related lifestyle features such as caffeine consumption and daily mood.
                    <br><br>Unlike other sleep based apps (such as Sleep Monitor) that only target the sleeping cycle, our product would incorporate the afore mentioned related issues.
                    <br><br>this guides users and allows them to discover how activities throughout the day can influence sleep.

            <section class="right">
                <h3>Pitch Two - Exercise</h3>
                <p>I'd like to pitch to you Shape Up. 
                    <br><br>Shape Up is a mobile app targeted at busy adults in the 25-35 range who live sedentary lives and don't think they have time for exercise. 
                    <br><br>It will offer small incremental activities that can be worked into your day without major disruption to your daily routines. 
                    <br><br>Unlike competing apps such as Sworkit, setup will not be involved and overwhelming to a beginner and will allow for short bursts of activities throughout the day such as 1 to 15 minute workouts, desk exercises and timed challenges such as 'how many calf raises can you do before the kettle boils'.

Sometimes what I’m reading is just that good that I’m so invested in reading on I will forgo sleep.</td>

                        <td>I sleep better in cold weather. And not just temperature. If it SOUNDS cold it helps – such as wind or rain. Of course, if the sound is too much it may wake me up or put me off getting out of bed.</td>
                        <td>I don't think the weather affects my sleep no, I can sleep under any weather. I usually wake up at 9 but lay in bed till 10, right before lectures start.</td>
                        <td>Not really, I can sleep in silence or to the tipper tapper of rain hitting the skylight. I do find that it's easier to sleep when it's cold though.</td>
                        <td>Yes, as I am a very weather dependent person, and it affects my mood a lot. If hte weather is nice, I am calmer and more relaxed during the day which allows me to sleep better, whereas bad weather causes stress and anxiety which make it harder to fall asleep.</td>

I don’t drink more thn one coffee or energy drink and if I have a few days of doing so I will then make sure I take two days off. I’m very careful with caffeine as I’ve still managed to remain fairly sensitive to it and I’m kind of proud of that.</td>

                        <td>I don't really drink caffeine all that much besides like 3 cups of teas a week. It doesn't really do anything for me.</td>

                        <td>I’d like to have much more consistent sleep, and wake up earlier without falling asleep again multiple times after I wake up for the first time. However, I don’t know how I can wake up earlier without ending up losing out on sleep as I stay up later. I’d also like to figure out exactly how much sleep I need to feel rested, as I still don’t know the amount that works for me.</td>
                        <td>I need more of it; my perfect amount of sleep is between 7 & 8 hours and I think I mostly get 4-6 hours at the moment. I like reading before bed and don’t want to change that but sometimes I do get wrapped up in what I’m reading so it would be good to go to bed earlier to offset this.</td>
                        <td>Probably the hours I sleep at, doing some research in my spare time I realised getting good rest really helps with metabolism</td>
                        <td>Would be nice to be able to fall asleep quickly rather than having to lay there pretending to be asleep for a while before drifting off.</td>
                        <td>I would change my sleeping posture and it is not great and probably affects my sleep in some type of way. I would also like to go to sleep earlier and spend less screen time in bed.</td>
                        <td>It's sufficient...I think it's ok. So, nothing really.</td>

                    As part of our research process, we interviewed each other and compiled the results to create a persona that we felt encompassed our issues, personality and desires. 
                    <br><br>Our persona is a 20 year old student who is a gamer and finds falling asleep challenging. they struggle with mental health issues and have been negatively affected by covid 19.

                    We took the data from our persona and constructed a user journey map for our app. 
                    <br>The app works best with long term use and so there is a slow but steady positive increase in feelings throughout the stages.
                    <br>The idea is that the user inputs their habits (caffeine intake, exercise amount, scree-time usage) each day.
                    <br>They then note their mood when they wake up and the app automatically tracks their sleep amount and quality.
                    <br>Combining the data creates a picture through which the user can interact and form their perfect routine.
